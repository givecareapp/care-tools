## Scoring & Interpretation

### Scoring System

All questions use a 1-5 scale for consistency. The assessment includes:
- **Regular scoring:** Higher values indicate better outcomes (questions 1-10, 12, 20-28, 30)
- **Reverse scoring:** Questions 11, 13-19 where higher values indicate greater need
- **Automatic normalization:** Scoring algorithms handle reverse-scored questions automatically

### Zone-Based Risk Assessment

Each priority zone (P1-P6) receives a normalized score:
- **P1: Relationship & Social Support** - Average of questions 1-8
- **P2: Physical Health** - Average of questions 29-30
- **P3: Housing & Environment** - Average of questions 9-12 (Q11 reverse-scored)
- **P4: Financial Resources** - Average of questions 13-20 (Q13-19 reverse-scored)
- **P5: Legal & Navigation** - Average of questions 21-26
- **P6: Emotional Wellbeing** - Average of questions 27-28

### Risk Thresholds

**Per Zone:**
- **Low Risk:** Zone score ≥ 3.5 (Generally stable)
- **Moderate Risk:** Zone score 2.5-3.49 (Some challenges)
- **High Risk:** Zone score < 2.5 (Significant needs)

**Overall Assessment:**
- **Low Risk:** All zones in low risk range
- **Moderate Risk:** 1-2 zones in high risk range
- **High Risk:** 3+ zones in high risk range or critical individual responses

### Priority Interventions

High-risk zones indicate immediate need for targeted resources:
- **P1 High:** Connect to support groups, counseling, respite care
